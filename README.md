Author: **alden (birch)**

_Copy disassembly nicely formatted for YARA rules._

## Description:
This is a really simple plugin that allows you to copy disassembly in a way that can be used in [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/) rules. You have the option to either copy the assembly code as it is or use address wildcarding to create more robust rules.

## Usage:

To copy the disassembly you desire, select it regardless of the view. Next, navigate to Plugins > Copy for YARA > [Choose between Wildcard Addresses or Normal]. The resulting formatted text will then be automatically copied to your clipboard.
